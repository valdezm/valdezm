<img width="1208" height="510" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 135156" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10031d1e-7d08-4d99-85c1-793907b61cd9" />

My name is **Mark Valdez** and I'm a builder. I'm a Computer Scientist with an extremely diverse skill-set and a passion for adopting emerging technologies to solve early stage startup problems. I've been building software solutions for over 15 years, starting as an instructor developing Computer Science curriculum, and working my way through startups, enterprise companies, and now as a founder.

I currently lead [GoodBruce.com](https://goodbruce.com) as **Founder & CTO**, where I'm building an AI-native marketplace platform that enables users to sell items via SMS or chat‚Äîeverything is done completely using AI. Prior to this, I spent time at [Upright Labs](https://uprightlabs.co) and [Advekit](https://advekit.com), where I worked on API integrations for recommerce platforms and greenfield projects in Mental Healthcare respectively.

I'm passionate about developing software solutions from the ground up that are forward-looking and optimize for rapid delivery to market. I have worked with cross-functional teams as an Independent Contributor (IC) and within Agile Scrum as a Technical Lead. My commitment to empathy and servant leadership, combined with my technical expertise and track record of driving results, make me excited about tackling complex problems.
